What is youtube-dl?
-------------------

youtube-dl is a command-line program written in Python to download online videos from websites including YouTube, Vimeo, Soundcloud, and many others.

Installation
------------

youtube-dl can be installed in many ways.  The preferred way to install is using pip: ``pip install youtube-dl``.  

youtube-dl can also be installed via a package manager (e.g. ``sudo apt install youtube-dl``), but these versions are almost always outdated, due to the fast pace that websites are updated.

FFmpeg is necessary for merging video and audio and downloading HLS and DASH.  Instructions for installing FFmpeg can be found at https://ffmpeg.org/download.html.  avconv can also be used, but it is not recommended.

PhantomJS is necessary for extracting videos from Openload and PornHub.  Instructions for installing PhantomJS can be found at http://phantomjs.org/download.html.

Basic usage
-----------

To download a video, simply run ``youtube-dl videourl``.  The video will be downloaded in the highest quality available, unless FFmpeg is not installed, in which case it will be downloaded in the highest quality containing both video and audio in one file.
