Configuration
=============


You can configure youtube-dl by placing any supported command line
option to a configuration file. On Linux and macOS, the system wide
configuration file is located at ``/etc/youtube-dl.conf`` and the user
wide configuration file at ``~/.config/youtube-dl/config``. On Windows,
the user wide configuration file locations are
``%APPDATA%\youtube-dl\config.txt`` or
``C:\Users\<user name>\youtube-dl.conf``. Note that by default
configuration file may not exist so you may need to create it yourself.

For example, with the following configuration file youtube-dl will
always extract the audio, not copy the mtime, use a proxy and save all
videos under ``Movies`` directory in your home directory:

::

    # Lines starting with # are comments

    # Always extract audio
    -x

    # Do not copy the mtime
    --no-mtime

    # Use this proxy
    --proxy 127.0.0.1:3128

    # Save all videos under Movies directory in your home directory
    -o ~/Movies/%(title)s.%(ext)s

Note that options in configuration file are just the same options aka
switches used in regular command line calls thus there **must be no
whitespace** after ``-`` or ``--``, e.g. ``-o`` or ``--proxy`` but not
``- o`` or ``-- proxy``.

You can use ``--ignore-config`` if you want to disable the configuration
file for a particular youtube-dl run.

You can also use ``--config-location`` if you want to use custom
configuration file for a particular youtube-dl run.

Authentication with ``.netrc`` file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may also want to configure automatic credentials storage for
extractors that support authentication (by providing login and password
with ``--username`` and ``--password``) in order not to pass credentials
as command line arguments on every youtube-dl execution and prevent
tracking plain text passwords in the shell command history. You can
achieve this using a ```.netrc``
file <https://stackoverflow.com/tags/.netrc/info>`__ on a per extractor
basis. For that you will need to create a ``.netrc`` file in your
``$HOME`` and restrict permissions to read/write by only you:

::

    touch $HOME/.netrc
    chmod a-rwx,u+rw $HOME/.netrc

After that you can add credentials for an extractor in the following
format, where *extractor* is the name of the extractor in lowercase:

::

    machine <extractor> login <login> password <password>

For example:

::

    machine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password
    machine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password

To activate authentication with the ``.netrc`` file you should pass
``--netrc`` to youtube-dl or place it in the `configuration
file <#configuration>`__.

On Windows you may also need to setup the ``%HOME%`` environment
variable manually. For example:

::

    set HOME=%USERPROFILE%
